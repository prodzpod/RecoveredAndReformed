  * Its main attack is a powerful *laser* that will melt any opponent that stands in its way.
  * It creates a *shield* around itself that protects itself from faraway harm.
  * When it reaches a health threshold, It will *rise up* from the ground for a moment, retreating itself from harm. 
  * [Spikestrip](https://thunderstore.io/package/SpikestripModding/Spikestrip2_0) compat: Beware of the enemies it *summons!* Watch the ground...

  * Its ability to sneak up on foe is unmatched, to a point where it is *invisible* and *invulnerable* during its charge.
  * The melee attack of the assassin temporarily makes you *frail!* make sure to retreat if you're hit.
  * [AccurateEnemies](https://thunderstore.io/package/Moffein/AccurateEnemies) compat: the enemy is extra accurate with its ranged, *shuriken* hit.

* [Forgotten Relics](https://thunderstore.io/package/PlasmaCore3/Forgotten_Relics) compat: Adds **Bell Tower**, a boss brass contraption monster.

  * Bell Tower is a support-focused stationary boss that frequently *summons* other contraptions. 
  * This does not mean itself does not pack a punch however, as its *projectiles* are as deadly as its younger sibling.
  * The powerful *ground slam* is enough to put you in low health in just one shot! Make sure to get off the ground when it raises its base and prepares its attack.

* Ability to spawn Elite variants of Magma Worm and Overloading Worm.
